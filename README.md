# First_Semester_Project
Project by Shariq Zia.
<p>This is my first-semester project in the C language, where I have designed an Audio Frequency Visualizer. It represents the intensity of my voice frequencies in the form of stars ("*"), showing where the frequency is higher and where it is lower.</p>
